- Realism: Eye Candy 7 renders realistic effects that are difficult or impossible to achieve in Photoshop alone, such as Fire, Chrome, and the new Lightning. Effects like Animal Fur, Smoke, and Reptile Skin are rendered in exquisite detail down to individual hairs, turbulent wisps, and shiny scales. Eye Candy helps designs look natural and organic[^1^] [^2^] [^4^].
- Scalability: Eye Candy 7 scales effects to match the size of your current artwork. That means that you can create effects for any resolution and output device without losing quality or pixelation. Eye Candy 7 also supports CMYK mode and 16-bits/channel, which are needed for professional print work[^1^] [^2^].
- Flexibility: Eye Candy 7 allows you to draw effects into a new layer, leaving your original artwork untouched. That means that you can easily edit, hide, or delete the effects without affecting the source image. You can also apply multiple effects to the same layer or combine them with other Photoshop features for endless possibilities[^1^] [^2^].
- Creativity: Eye Candy 7 helps you quickly explore and design looks with easy to recognize icons and presets. You can preview the effects by simply mousing over them, and adjust the settings with sliders and checkboxes. You can also use the random seed generator to create unique variations of each effect[^2^] [^3^].

With Alien Skin Eye Candy 7, you can transform your images into stunning artworks with realistic and creative effects. Whether you need to add fire, chrome, lightning, fur, smoke, reptile skin, or any other effect, Eye Candy 7 has you covered. Download it today and unleash your imagination!
